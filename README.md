# Clinic CRM

Welcome to the Clinic Customer Relationship Management System, designed to help clinics improve their customer experience and case management. With this system, clinics can easily implement features such as a discount system, announcement system, and SMS messaging system to keep their clients informed and engaged. This system benefits both clinics and their clients by streamlining case management and improving communication.

## Features

* Real-time appointment request monitoring: Allows clinics to track and manage incoming appointment requests in real-time.
* User-friendly interface: Provides an easy-to-use interface for both clients and clinics to access and manage information.
* Automatic report generation: Generates reports for clinics to view their financial data and track their performance.
* SMS messaging system: Sends text messages to clients to remind them of appointments and inform them of any discounts or promotions.
* Referral discount system: Encourages clients to refer their friends and family to the clinic by offering a discount on future services.
* Case management: Organizes and tracks client cases for each clinic, allowing for efficient and effective management.

This project utilizes the following technologies:

* Node.js and the Nest.js framework: Node.js is a popular runtime environment for building scalable, high-performance web applications, and Nest.js is a fast, minimalist framework for building web servers and APIs on top of Node.js. We chose these technologies for their speed, efficiency, and ability to handle large amounts of data.
* Socket.IO: Socket.IO is a library for real-time, bidirectional communication between web clients and servers. It allows us to create real-time notifications and a real-time chat feature for clinics and clients to communicate with each other.
* MongoDB: MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, allowing for easy data access and manipulation. We use it to store and manage the large amounts of data generated by the system.


## Key Features

Some of the key features of this project include:

* Real-time notifications: Using Socket.IO, we are able to provide real-time notifications to clinics and clients about updates or changes to appointments.
* Real-time chat: Clinics and clients can use the real-time chat feature to communicate with each other and coordinate appointments or resolve any issues.
* Customizable interface: Clinics can customize the interface to fit their specific needs and preferences.
* Reliable case management: The system provides an organized and efficient way for clinics to track and manage their clients' cases.
